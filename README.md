**Image PreProcessing:**
1. For converting images to dataframe, we have used python keras library instead of R as the R one was crashing. 
2. After creating the dataframe we exported the values to the csv format 
3. We then created an R model for Image preprocessing in which we directly used the dataframe csv for tee, mythical and animals one by one creating three separate file for calculating each
4. Then we ran the lnear model to find the accuracy, mean square value
5. We ran it five times for each to fetch the mse values


**Text Processing**
1. Similar to the image we created the dataframe for the text in python and then exported  the data to R in a csv format
2. We created a model to take the datafeames as created above and ran the model for the trainig data
